I love bringing ideas to life with code. I'm not always feeling inspired, but when I am, I have a hard time putting ideas down until I've seen them through. They will linger in my mind and consume my thoughts until I build them ðŸ’­ âœ¨

My GitHub profile is a mixture of data vizualization projects and GraphQL starters that I've build during the course of my work at @apollographql. My favorite platform to build for is the web.
