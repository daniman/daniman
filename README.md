I love bringing ideas to life with code. I'm not always feeling inspired, but when I am, I have a hard time putting ideas down until I've seen them through â€“â€“Â they will consume my thoughts until I build them ðŸ’­ âœ¨

My GitHub profile is a mixture of data vizualization projects and GraphQL projects that I've build during the course of my work at @apollographql. I built a [full clone](https://splendoor.netlify.app/) of the [Splendor Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_(game)) with Apollo Server, Apollo Client, Typescript, and React that my friends like in particular. My favorite platform to build for is the web.
