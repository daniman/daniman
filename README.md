I love bringing ideas to life with code. I'm not always feeling inspired, but when I am, I often have a hard time putting ideas down until I've completely seen them through.

For the last 4+ years, I've been working at @apollographql to help make GraphQL easier to use and more accessible to more people. My GitHub profile is a mix of frontend projects and GraphQL starters.
