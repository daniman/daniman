I love bringing ideas to life with code. When I'm feeling inspired, I have a hard time putting ideas down until I've tried them out â€“â€“Â they consume my thoughts ðŸ’­ âœ¨

My GitHub profile is a mixture of data vizualization projects and GraphQL projects that I've build during the course of my work at [@apollographql](https://github.com/apollographql). I'm particularly proud of the [clone](https://splendoor.netlify.app/) I built of the [Splendor Board Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_(game)) with Apollo Server, Apollo Client, Typescript, and React.

My favorite platform to build for is the web.
